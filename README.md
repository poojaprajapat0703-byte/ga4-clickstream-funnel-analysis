📊 GA4 Clickstream Funnel & Sequence Analysis


An end-to-end GA4-style clickstream analytics project that analyzes user event sequences, funnels, drop-offs, and conversions using Python, Pandas, and Streamlit.
Built to simulate real-world GA4 event-level data analysis and deployed as an interactive web app.

🚀 Project Overview

Modern analytics teams don’t just look at metrics — they analyze user journeys.
This project replicates how GA4 clickstream data is used in real companies to:

1. Understand how users move through events
2. Identify where users drop off
3. Measure funnel conversion performance
4. Analyze time between events
5. Discover high-impact behavioral patterns
   

🧠 Key Features

1. Event-level GA4 clickstream analysis
2. Session-wise user journey reconstruction
3. Top event sequence discovery
4. Funnel conversion & drop-off analysis
5. Time-to-conversion insights
6. Interactive Streamlit dashboard
7. Fully deployed & shareable app
   

📊 What This App Does

1️⃣ Data Loading

1. Upload GA4-style event data
2. Auto-validates schema
3. Handles large datasets efficiently

2️⃣ Exploratory Sequence Analysis

1. Top user event paths
2. Session-based behavior tracking
3. Frequency-based sequence ranking

3️⃣ Funnel Analysis

1. Step-wise funnel creation
2. Conversion rate per step
3. Drop-off identification

4️⃣ Drop-off & Time Analysis

1. Where users abandon the funnel
2. Time taken between critical events
3. Bottleneck identification

🧩 Business Use Cases

This analysis directly supports:

1. Product funnel optimization
2. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
3. Growth & marketing analytics
4. User behavior diagnostics
5. GA4 reporting & insights

🛠️ Tech Stack

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Streamlit
5. Matplotlib / Plotly
6. GitHub
7. Streamlit Community Cloud

🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

1. Mimics real GA4 event-level data
2. Business-focused, not just charts
3. End-to-end ownership (data → app → deployment)
4. Strong storytelling for interviews
5. Demonstrates product + analytics thinking
